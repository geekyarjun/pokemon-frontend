# Vite React App

## Overview

This project is a React application bootstrapped with **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds. You can access its live version here https://pokemon-frontend-neon.vercel.app/ . The API response is extremley slow because the backend deployed to the free server of Render. I would highly recommend to run it on local.

---

## Assumptions

- Since there is no sign in feature, pokemon added to favourite is global

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v20 or later)
- **npm** (v6 or later) or **yarn**

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/geekyarjun/pokemon-frontend.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Create `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
# Vite settings
VITE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3100
```

> **Note:** Replace placeholder values (e.g., `http://localhost:3100/api/v1`) with actual value.

### 4. Start the Application

#### Development Mode

```
npm run dev
```

This starts the application in development mode. The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.

#### Production Mode

```
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This builds the application and serves the production build locally.

---

## Scripts

- **npm run dev**: Starts the development server.
- **npm run build**: Builds the application for production.
- **npm run preview**: Serves the production build locally.

## Environment Variables

Here are the key environment variables used in this project:

| Variable         | Description               | Default Value         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------- |
| VITE_APP_API_URL | Base URL for API requests | http://localhost:3100 |

## Troubleshooting

1.  **Environment Variables Not Loaded**:

    - Ensure the `.env` file exists in the root directory and contains the required variables.

2.  **Port Already in Use**:

    - Modify the `VITE_PORT` value in the `vite.config.js` or terminate the process using the port.

3.  **API Errors**:

    - Verify that the `VITE_APP_API_URL` is correct and the API server is running.
